    <p>Project CatGhost is an attempt to have a place to share both Wick Editor and Scratch projects!!! We are trying to make it easier to join! Including:
    <ul> finding a way to teach Wick </ul>
    <ul> Helping to transition from drag-and-drop to text-based </ul>
    <ul> and more! </ul>
    Hopefully, you can see our reasoning, as well as there needsing to be a third-party Scratch site.</p>
